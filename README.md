### What I learned
i think one of the most major things i learned in this small frontend project 
was working with ejs and express. i've had working with API's before so that was no problem for me however one of the hardest parts was error handling and working with ejs since i didn't have much experience with it.

### Continued development

wrtting better code struture and maybe work on adding more features on the project and more animations
